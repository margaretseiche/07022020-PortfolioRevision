# 07022020-PortfolioRevision

Github deployed at https://margaretseiche.github.io/07022020-PortfolioRevision/

To start, I decided to add an introductory page.  What had been 'index.html' before became 'about.html'.

index.html is now a page that I had drafted before as a one-page portfolio summary; for the moment, I omitted contact information from that page, as I have a separate 'contact.html' page.  If time allows, I may add the social media icons in a footer of the front page.  

index.html has a background photo.  If possible, when the screen shrinks, I would like for this to go underneath the other content --- still trying to accomplish this (as at the moment, the background is an overall div for the photo and the other content).

Adding the extra page also required adjusting the header for the additional navigational tab, including resetting media queries.

On the contact page, I corrected the columns (4 had col, 1 had col-sm) so that the icons would collapse properly when the screen shrinks.  I also centered the icons within the columns.

On the portfolio page, I had 4 projects from before the coding course.  (One used Scratch, which I learned during the pre-course work.)  I decided to split the screen, showing coding projects and other projects.
